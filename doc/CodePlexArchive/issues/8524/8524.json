    "Description": "I can't see an easy way to reorder Elements and Attributes.  The xsd that is generated causes all elements to be in sequence, which in my case is not desired.  I feel there should be a way manually re-order elements and attributes, or have a way to set how the elements appear in xsd (ie sequence, choice, all).  \nÂ \nThanks",

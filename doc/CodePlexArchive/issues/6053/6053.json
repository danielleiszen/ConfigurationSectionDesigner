    "Description": "The section.Instance property returns null if the section is nested within groups.  This is because you need to pass the path including groups to the GetSection method. E.g. for:\n \n  <myCompany xmlns=\"myCompany.Configuration\">\n    <Web>\n      <UITesting>\n        <environment name=\"Test1\" >\n          <location url=\"http://host.domain.com/app.html\"/>\n          <login enabled=\"true\" username=\"user\" password=\"password\"/>\n        </environment>\n      </UITesting>\n    </Web>\n  </myCompany>\n \nYou need to call ConfigurationManager.GetSection(\"myCompany/Web/UITesting/environment\");\n \nFor now I don't generate the singleton and just instatiate the sections myself.\n \nThanks!",

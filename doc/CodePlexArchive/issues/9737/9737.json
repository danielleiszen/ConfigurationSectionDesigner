      "Message": "This is a problem with Windows XP / Server 2003. The windows maximum path char length is exceeded due to how those systems organize the user folders. I made some effort to improve this situation (by shortening some file names), but this issue is still possible depending on how long the username is. I see no way to better fix this issue without changing the project names / owner names, which is not a great option. This issue is present on many other VS extensions as well.",

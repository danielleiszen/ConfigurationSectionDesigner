      "Message": "I'm sorry that you're experiencing this problem, but this problem is unavoidable on some computer systems due to the silly limitations Microsoft has placed on system file path length in their APIs. Never mind that NTFS supports paths up to roughly 32,000 characters long, the Windows API is coded such that most applications can't handle paths longer than 259.",

      "Message": "My comments from previous report of this issue. It might add something to Alex's response.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem with Windows XP / Server 2003. The windows maximum path char length is exceeded due to how those systems organize the user folders. The VS extension folder structure definitely doesn't help, but we have to live with that.  I made some effort to improve this situation by shortening some file names, but this issue is still possible depending on how long the username is. I see no way to better fix this issue without changing the project names / owner names, which is not a great option. This issue is present on many other VS extensions as well.",

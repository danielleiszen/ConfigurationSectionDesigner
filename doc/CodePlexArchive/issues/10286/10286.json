    "Description": "I install Configuration Section Designer, and it was generating code correctly.  but suddenly and without any reasons.  The cs file is no more generated, I got the following error message:\n\n> The custom tool 'CsdFileGenerator' failed.  Guid should contain 32 digits with 4 dashes (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)\n\n.\n.\nThe message seems misleading, because I uninstall Configuration Section Manager, and I still getting the same message every time I right click on CSD file and click \"Run Custom Tool\".",

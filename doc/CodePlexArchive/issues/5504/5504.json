It would break the sense of the attribute.\r\n\r\nHowever I assume that a lot of projects are not going to expand these classes in other files. Maybe you could add setting in DSL allowing to workaround this rule.\r\n\r\nIf you do not think it is a good alternative, let's close this Work Item so I keep going with the patch as I really need it. FxCop is so straight!",

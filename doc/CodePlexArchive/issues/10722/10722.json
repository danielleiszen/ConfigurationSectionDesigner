    "Description": "There is a class in the Microsoft Enterprise Library called PolymorphicConfigurationElementCollection<T> which allows a configuration element to contain a collection of config elements of polymorphic type.  This turned out to be fairly useful to me, but using it meant that I had to move my configuration section and configuration element classes away from CSD.  It would be great if CSD offered a similar capability.",

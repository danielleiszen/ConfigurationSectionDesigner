This issue report is a perfect example of how to submit issues.

Number of project items = {1}.\", project.Name, project.ProjectItems.Count);\n \nFor projects that VS can't load, ProjectItems is null. If there is such a project in your solution that is higher up (ie. in the root of the solution or in a solution folder that is higher up), the above code throws an NullReferenceException.\n \nI can see, that there are also instances in the Main branch where Project.ProjectItems is used wihtout a null check.",

      "Message": "I was able to reproduce the issue by adding a dummy project to the \"Debugging\" solution, then using the \"Unload Project\" command. The unloaded project (dimmed in gray) ends up causing the exact same problem as mentioned in this issue report. Thanks to the excellent details reported by demus, namely the location of the \"unloaded\" project in the solution tree, I was able to solve the issue quickly. After a few more tests, I will commit the fix to source control.\r\n\r\n",

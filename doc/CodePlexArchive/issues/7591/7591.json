    "Description": "The installer does not ask for elevated priviledges when installing and installation fail because of this. It needs this even when running as administrator on the operating systems. The settings are ignored on operating systems not supporting this.\n \nFix:\nThe installer package does not display the property needed for this but it is in the msi text\n \nOpen the setup \nFind\n       \"MsiBootstrapper\"\n        {\n        \"LangId\" = \"3:1033\"\n        \"RequiresElevation\" = \"11:FALSE\"\n        }\n \nChange the above to this\n       \"MsiBootstrapper\"\n        {\n        \"LangId\" = \"3:1033\"\n        \"RequiresElevation\" = \"11:TRUE\"\n        }\n \nThe installer will now ask for elevated priviledges on windows 7 and server 2008",

Surprisingly, I've found WiX help to be a little lacking, and have not been able to find examples of how to do this. Don't other developers run into this issue??? It may be as simple as upgrading to Wix 3.5, but I'll have to see.",

After making changes directly in the package everything seems ok. Unfortunately I did not find place where the .pkgdef file is stored (maybe it get generated during build process so I was not able to upload patch). Please make appropriate changes.",

I installed the \"MSBuild.Community.Tasks\" library and added a regex text replace task that fixes the offending entry in the pkgdef file before the VSIX is built. I need to add some comments about this for the other developers before uploading source code, but will include the build with this fix in this post. I can't confirm that it works at the moment, so if you have a moment to try it out, I would appreciate it. Thanks.",

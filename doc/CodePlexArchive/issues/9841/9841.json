I have created my diagram but the tool fails to generate any code. I get the warning \"The custom tool 'CsdFileGenerator' failed.  Unrecognized Guid format.\" and then nothing happens.",

This worked, and I could design my CSD files.\r\n\r\nSource Control:\n1. For source control integration, I just manually copied the relevant files into my main solution after making any changes in this temporary project. \n2. You can of course set this up that this \"seperate\" solution/project is in the same folder, then you dont have to copy the files manually from some other location all the time.",

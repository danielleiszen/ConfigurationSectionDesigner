    "ClosedComment": "Just keep in mind that CSD writes the whole XML schema for you, which is what provides the intellisense in the primary configuration file. Without CSD you wouldn&#39;t have any intellisense at all unless you wrote the schema manually.After researching the issue, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that implementing support for intellisense in external files is more or less impossible. However, anybody may feel free to prove me wrong by uploading a patch to the contrary.",

It's possible, but I decided to leave it like that since (1) it is just a sample file and (2) the assembly name isn't required to be present in the configuration file (unless the project is strong-named if I'm not mistaken).\n\nSo unless you have a really compelling reason to go the extra mile for that sample file, I'm closing this issue - sorry.",

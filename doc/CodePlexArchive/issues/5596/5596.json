    "Description": "Ever though the code generator writes a setter for a configuration attribute property, if you try to set a value in order to save a setting, you will get a ConfigurationErrorsException - The configuration is read only.\n \nThe ConfigurationElement defines a virtual method for IsReadOnly().  To avoid the exception and actually assign your values at run-time you must override this method in your ConfigurationSection or ConfigurationElement class like this:\n \npublic override bool IsReadOnly()\n{\n    return false;\n}\n \nIt would be nice if the TextTransformer could automatically write this override in each class that has an attribute that is NOT read only.",

      "Message": "Huh, that's strange. Not that I don't believe you, but I've never encountered that exception, even though I've loaded and saved configurations over and and over. I'll add it anyway though, seeing how a Google search about it has people saying it's necessary, including Microsoft themselves. I wonder how so many people have used the tool without coming across this issue, or at least without reporting this issue.",

      "Message": "I'm having issues understanding exactly what it means. It's not on a per-attribute basis, it's on a per element/section basis. Which means that it needs to be added as a setting on the elements and not their individual properties.",

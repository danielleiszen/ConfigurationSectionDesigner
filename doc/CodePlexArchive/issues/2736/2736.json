      "Message": "That's actually a good question, because I've never seen any configuration file that has plain text inside a configuration element. I've been looking at the .NET Configuration system but I can't find a way to enable this type of configuration file, so unless you happen to know how .NET supports this I'm afraid I can't implement this work item...\r\n\r\nThe workaround would of course be move the text to an attribute of the address configuration element as such:\r\n<address url=\"http://www.service.com/Service/dataService.svc\" />",

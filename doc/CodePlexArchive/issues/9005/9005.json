    "Description": "Tried creating a pretty basic configuration: a single collection of strings. The files generated fine, and I copied over the config info to my web.config. However at run time, when accessing values, I get this exception: \n \n\"An error occurred creating the configuration section handler for javaScriptSettings: Could not load file or assembly 'WebDemo.Lib' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\n \nWhat's going on here? I've double and triple checked that I copied over the config section handlers properly.",

My configs always follow the \"MyLib.MyConfigSection, MyLib\" pattern (as do many Microsoft open source projects).",

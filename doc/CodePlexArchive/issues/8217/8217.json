    "Description": "When creating elements and adding them to a section, they are defined in the config schema as xsd:sequence.  This means that they must appear in the .config file in the specified order.  These elements should be defined as xsd:all to avoid having to specify config elements in a pre-defined order.\nÂ \nBTW, this add-in is wonderful and has saved me a great deal of time and wrote coding!  Thanks!",

      "Message": "I was validating some generated schemas and saw a potential issue with this change. The unbounded attributes in the \"choice\" element are allowing duplicate collection elements to be entered. By removing the minOccurs and maxOccurs from the \"choice\" attributes (leave them in elements), expected behavior is restored. There may be a reason why this is valid behavior (I haven't tested behavior in the generated classes), but I am re-opening for now so we can look into this.",

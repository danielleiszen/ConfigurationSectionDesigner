    "Description": "Configuration sections defined in the <configSections> element does not have their public key token set when these sections belong to a signed assembly.\n \nEDIT 10/01/2010:\n \nSample:\n \n<configSections>\n\t<section name=\"MySimpleSection\" type=\"MyCompany.GreatProduct.Configuration, GreatProduct.Core, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" />\n</configSections>\n \nIf you use a signed assembly containing your ConfigurationSection outside its own project and you do not define the PKT corresponding to the assembly signature, the configuration file wont load and make the application crash.\n \nYou can easily retrieve this information using an AssemblyName object and its method GetPublicKeyToken().",

The problem about doing that is that, well... at the time of the generation of the sample file, which is design time, I have no access to the assembly that it belongs to. So saying that I can easily retrieve this information using AssemblyName and GetPublicKeyToken() assumes that I have access to the assembly. Which I don't.",

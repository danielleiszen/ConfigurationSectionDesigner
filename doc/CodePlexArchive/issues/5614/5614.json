Do you have any more info on what you meant by creating elements with different inheritance modifiers? If I'm going to spend the time to do this, I want to make sure I get it all.\r\n\r\nThanks, and nice work on this project.",

      "Message": "I was essentially going to let configuration elements have two extra properties, \"Base Class\", which is a reference to another class of its type (I.e. a configuration section can only inherit from another configuration section. In order to do this right, I'd have to read up on Domain Relationships some more) and \"Inheritance Modifier\", which would be a choice between \"(none)\", \"abstract\" and \"sealed\". I haven't quite thought out how I would display the inheritance graphically in the designer yet, but I figured I'd come up with something once I had worked a bit on it.\r\n\r\nThat's how I planned doing it, and it probably wouldn't take me too long to do. (although the research might take quite a while compared to the actual implementation.)",

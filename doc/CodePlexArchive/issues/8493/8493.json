    "Description": "Hei, \n \ni dowloaded and installed the CSD for VS 2010 and created sample project. Now when i save the project the output looks promising:\n \n------ CSD file generation started: Configuration document: C:\\Users\\xxxx.xxxxxx\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\testConfApp\\testConfApp\\testConfApp.csd ------\n* Searching for configuration project handle... found!\n* Cleaning up existing files... complete!\n \n \n But when i look at the sample .config file what should be generated then it looks like this:\n \n \n \n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!--\n<auto-generated>\n    This code was generated by a tool.\n \n     Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if\n    the code is regenerated.\n</auto-generated>\n-->\n<configuration>\n\t<configSections>\n\t\t<section name=\"tutorialSections\" type=\"testConfApp.TutorialSections, testConfApp\"/>\n\t</configSections>\n\t<tutorialSections xmlns=\"urn:testConfApp\">\n\t\t<!--\n\t\tThis is just a minimal sample configuration file that shows how to declare\n\t\tthe configuration sections.\n \n\t\tBecause an XML Schema Definition (XSD) is generated for each configuration\n\t\tsection, it should be trivial to edit these files because you have\n\t\tIntelliSense on the XML definition.\n\t\t-->\n\t</tutorialSections>\n</configuration>\n \n \nHere's a screenshot of the csd designer view:\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/20/csdp.png/\n \nAnybody having similar problem?",

    "Description": "I tried this tool in VS 2015 (Update 3) and followed up the tutorial. \nI like the idea, however it does not generate proper XSD. The XSD file only contains text: ErrorGeneratingOutput.\n\nThere is warning in \"Error List\" window (not sure if it relates to XSD generation)\n\nWarning |\tCannot find a schema that defines target namespace | 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/dsltools/ConfigurationSectionDesigner', schema validation skipped.\tConfigurationProject1\n\nCan't see any error details. What can be the problem?",

Since CodePlex is shutting down, I will likely move this over to GITHUB,. On GitHub, it is easy for others to contribute, so that will hopefully make this project more active. \r\n\r\nI think I resolved this a while ago, but only uploaded the fix to the source code, not the downloadable build. I'll have to check.\n",

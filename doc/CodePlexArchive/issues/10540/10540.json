      "Message": "Hi David,\r\n\r\nWe are looking at implementing some better debugging functionality to help resolve issues like this. I saw this error once before in a new project, but the problem disappeared before I could troubleshoot. It might be a problem with the function that recursively traverses solution files. I'll attempt to reproduce this again and figure this out once and for all.",

I still have an issue when a brand new project has not been saved, but should solve that soon. I will release a beta version once I test these changes.",

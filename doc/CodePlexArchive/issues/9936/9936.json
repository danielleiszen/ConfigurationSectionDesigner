    "Description": "It would be very useful to be able to export the diagram as an image.\nWhile small diagrams may be captured using a screenshot and then cropped, in case of large diagrams (or small screens!) the diagram may not fit the screen at a zoom level high enough for things to be readable.\n\nThis functionality is available in other similar diagrams, e.g. EntityFramework's edmx editor, as a right-click-on-the-canvas menu option.\n\nI'm hoping the actual functionality is provided by Visual Studio's diagramming module, and it just needs to be exposed by CSD.",

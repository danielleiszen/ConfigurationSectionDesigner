    "Description": "I have downloaded the latest source code and built the project in Main-2010 folder. I installed the created vsix file.\n \nI opened VS2010 but could not find new project template. I then created a new class library project and added a new item to it using teh Configuration Section Designer item. I am able to access the toolbox items. But when I insert a configuration element and right click on it to add attributes, I get the following error and I am not able to do any further.\n \n1. Error on right-clicking on a configuration element or right-clicking on the \"Configuration Section Model\" item of the Configuration Section Explorer view: \"Value does not fall within the expected range\"\n2. Error on right-clicking on empty area on the designer or right-clicking on any child items of \"Configuration Section Model\" item of the Configuration Section Explorer view: \"The parameter is incorrect (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070057 (E_INVALIDARG))\"\n \nI am not able to do anything further. Is this a configuration error or a known problem?\n \nTo Add, I have VS2008 also installed on the same PC and the configuration section designer is working fine in VS2008.\n \nThanks\nRavi",

I was about to give up using the tool because of the error, so I decided to try it for the last time on another VM. This time the CSD tool worked perfectly and I can see/use the context menu after a right click. I don't know why it worked in this other VM because all of the VMs I tested it on came from the same image.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea on what's causing this error?

I hope I didn't make changes to my system throughout this process that will cause it to only work for me. Also, perhaps someone might want to take the time to figure out what attributes in the original project file caused the right-click issue. Then, the codeplex version can be fixed.",

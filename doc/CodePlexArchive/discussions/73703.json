    "Html": "<p>I too find the decision to make the VS2010 version 2.0 a bit weird. It's not like you'd make an application that was made with .NET 1.1 be v1.x and as soon as you switched to .NET 2.0 make your application v2.x. I find it particularly bothersome, because I was&nbsp;considering making a 2.0 release of the VS2008 tool sometime, which now won't be possible, or at the very least get rather confusing.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Since naming the VS2010 edition v2.0 was my idea I guess I should chime in :-)</p>\r\n<p>I agree that there aren't a lot of new features to warrant a major version number update, but I would also find it very confusing to have a v1.6.1 that works with VS2008 and a v1.7 for example that works with VS2010. And then a v2.0 for VS2008 and a v2.1 for VS2010? I don't know... So maybe it would be better to keep the real version number the same then (as long as the functionality is the same) and just name the releases on CodePlex differently, e.g. &quot;v1.7 for VS2008&quot; and &quot;v1.7 for VS2010&quot;? But then these should be functionally equivalent or it will be even more confusing. So Alex, if you'd add a bunch of features for v2.0 then I hope a VS2010 edition with the same features would be on the roadmap?</p>\r\n<p>In the end, you guys do what you think is best, at this point I'm just not involved enough to push any opinion either way.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Jelle</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Since I have not yet used VS2010, I cannot really give good input here, but if (and only&nbsp;if)&nbsp;most of the code is the same still, it should be possible to merge changes made in either branch back and forth as they are being made. That way, the two branches would stay in sync. Alternatively, it could be made a policy that any feature added in one branch also has to be added in the other. The final option is to let the two branches divert and&nbsp;become&nbsp;separate tools, meaning that you can't expect things to work the same in the VS2008 version and the VS2010 version. I've put my alternatives in the order that <em>I</em> prefer things take place... i.e. kept-in-sync-by-merge branches are best, kept-in-sync-but-not-by-merge branches are the second best, and diverting tools the least good option.</p>\r\n<p>That's my opinion, anyway. I've already given my opinion on the versioning issue, meaning I don't think a VS2010 release automatically makes the tool v2.0. Honestly, I think more discussion should be done on the whole versioning&nbsp;issue before a final decision is made.</p>",

Although there are some minor issues that can be worked around (like clicking right mouse button), it's working great. We built up all the configuration sections over different namespaces from scratch, and added validator-methods in partial class files.</p>\r\n<p>We even made the .xsd Style Sheet be referenced in App.config, with code hint and syntax check working! For this it is necessary to add xmlns=&quot;your_xml_namespace&quot; attribute to the configuration sections in App.config. After that, the generated code fails to work, because &quot;xmlns&quot; is not known configuration attribute obviously. Don't try to add a dummy &quot;xmlns&quot; attribute to every configuration section in the modeller! Even though this will make your project compile again, it will break code-hint and syntax check in App.config. Instead add a partial class with the same name and add an xmlns property to it manually. You could first create it in the modeller and then move the code for it over to your own class. This way you can design and generate freely in the modeller, even in multiple csd files, and the App.config syntax is checked instantly against the newly generated xsd files.</p>\r\n<p>Long story short: I can recommend using latest CSD in VS2010 and hope there is a stable release soon.</p>",

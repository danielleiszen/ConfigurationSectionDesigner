The transformation is quite simple, if I remember correctly, I think the .csd file itself is backwards compatible all the way, but the .csd.diagram file isn't. So what happens when you upgrade from that far back is that your diagram will be all jumbled, but otherwise everything will be there... The only way to really know what to fix would be to install 1.1, make a little experimental .csd, make a copy of the .csd.diagram file, then upgrade to 1.6, and load the project, fix your diagram, and then diff the two .csd.diagram files.</p>",

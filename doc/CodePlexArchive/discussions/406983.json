This is a list of permissions having a type {User | Group} and a name. There can be several items of the same type and several items of the same name.</p>\r\n<p>It makes sense not to be able to do this using a collection of type&nbsp;<code>BasicMap</code>; but what about&nbsp;<code>AddRemoveClearMap</code>&nbsp;collections? (Ok, the 'map' in&nbsp;<code>AddRemoveClearMap</code>&nbsp;doesn't help, I need list semantics).</p>\r\n<p>This is what CSD says when I try to configure it like this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Item Type of this collection does not have a key property.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ADChI.png\">screenshot</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Any pointers are welcome.</p>\r\n<p>PS.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1471051/11545\">This StackOverflow answer</a>&nbsp;suggests I add a bogus (unique) GUID property to the objects in the collection and use that as the key. Is there a way to bend CSD to allow that, short of editing\r\n the CSD source code?</p>\r\n",

Then you add a property to the element A, say Prop1 and set its type to B, and a connection is created between them to making clearÂ their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is that when you drag any of the element the shape for the element A will streach if the element B is at the right of the element A, and the property NameDecorator will be shown under the element A, if the element B is at the left of element A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis behavior occurs either with the binary bit, as well as with the source code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've gone through the source code, but found nothing that would generate such behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee the images linked below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/5220/elementsaandbbeforedraggz0.jpg\">Elements A and B before dragging element B.</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/7793/elementsaandbafterdragxb5.jpg\">Elements A and B after dragging element B.</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo Santos<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://pjondevelopment.50webs.com/\">http://pjondevelopment.50webs.com/</a> </p>\r\n",

It's on my list of things to look at but since it's really just a rendering issue (albeit a rather irritating one) I didn't put too much effort into it yet. But some day, I will :-) If you would happen to find it before that, please let me know :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJelle\r\n",

This is part of the generated collection classes.</li><li>Using List&lt;T&gt; would introduce a dependency on .NET 2.0 and at this point the generated configuration classes can even be used in .NET 1.x.</li><li>And finally, I don't think it's even possible to use List&lt;T&gt; as a configuration collection class :-) I've briefly tried it but didn't get it to work because it lacks the necessary metadata as described above.</li></ul>",

I haven't tested this but you might be able to fix it by going into the following directory and coping the ConfigurationSectionProject.zip file from there:<br /><br /><span class=\"codeInline\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\">C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplates\\CSharp\\1033</span><br /><br />You can then put it in either of these:<br /><ul><li>The same directory tree as above but using the German Locale Id instead of \"1033\" (see if there's another Locale Id present and copy it into that one)</li><li>&lt;My Documents&gt;\\Visual Studio 2008\\Templates\\ProjectTemplates\\Visual C#\\</li></ul><br />The zip file is in effect the project template, and I believe putting it in either of these locations should automatically pick it up. Let me know if it works :-)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jelle<br />",

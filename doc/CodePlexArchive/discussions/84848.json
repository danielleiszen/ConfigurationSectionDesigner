Looks great and promises to solve much pain!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, I have followed the getting started pages, adding a new section and some collections and elements&nbsp;etc. This all works well on the designer view. Then&nbsp;I flick to my own code classes and try to use the config section....which works -&nbsp;I get intellisense and everything!&nbsp;Brilliant!</p>\r\n<p>Problem is when&nbsp;I switch back to the designer view I keep getting the compiler warning:<br>&quot;Warning&nbsp;1&nbsp;The 'codeGenOptions' attribute is invalid - The value 'Singleton, XmlnsProperty' is invalid according to its datatype 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/dsltools/ConfigurationSectionDesigner:ConfigurationSectionCodeGenOptions' - The Enumeration constraint failed.&nbsp;C:\\Gordon\\Prototypes\\MyConsoleApp\\MyConsoleApp\\Config.csd&nbsp;14&nbsp;44&nbsp;MyConsoleApp&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers muchly in advance</p>",

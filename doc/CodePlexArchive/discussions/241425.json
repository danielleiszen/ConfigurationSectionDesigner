Assume Max is a non-required attribute of type double. At runtime, there's no difference between &lt;element Max=\"0.0\"/&gt; and &lt;element /&gt;. Both will return 0.0, but obviously a Max of 0.0 has a very different meaning than not having a Max.</p>\r\n<p>In the auto generated code, you can manually change the type of this property from double to double?, but you'd have to do this any time the code is regenerated. And although I only have two properties in my case, someone with many of these attributes would have to spend quite a bit of time changing the code. It would be great to have support for nullable types out of the box.</p>",
